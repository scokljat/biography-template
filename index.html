              <h2>BIOGRAPHY</h2>

              <h3>
                A life's work of embracing both the creative and the
                quantitative, developing thriving online businesses and enviable
                brands.
              </h3>

              <p>
                I have spent my entire adult life—and most of my (beleaguered)
                childhood—engrossed in internet business and the functions that
                drive it. As a somewhat atypical child—emigrating war-torn
                Yugoslavia for the United States at the age of ten—I found a
                virtual refuge in the online world, and quickly became enamored
                with design, development, and marketing on the (then new)
                medium.
              </p>
              <p>
                By high school, I founded Gamers.net, establishing the site as a
                preeminent gaming network that attracted millions of monthly
                visitors. The company was eventually acquired as my interest in
                gaming waned (along with inflated revenues of the dot-com boom),
                but a passion for online business & design remained. Twenty
                years, countless projects, and numerous ups-and-downs later, I'm
                still as obsessed as ever.

                Most recently, I spent four years at Squarespace, a SaaS website
                publishing platform based in NYC. As an early employee (the
                headcount grew 25x during my tenure), I instituted the company's
                marketing architecture and scaled the growth initiatives,
                culminating in paying subscriber growth of >2000% and a
                valuation of over a billion dollars.
              </p>
              <p>
                Prior to Squarespace, I was an early employee at a Seattle-based
                education startup, where I built the flagship consumer website
                and grew it into a top-500 property (Alexa, 2007–2010). This
                helped the company become one of the most profitable (net
                margin) and fastest-growing private companies in the US, leading
                to a $160M acquisition.
              </p>
              <p>
                I currently reside in Manhattan and continue to work in tech,
                both professionally and as a hobby. I have a keen appreciation
                of good design, which plays a major role in every facet of my
                life, bordering on obsessive. I also teach Internet Marketing
                (DM435) at FIT; it allows me to impart my life's positive
                influences onto a new generation, which is incredibly rewarding.
